# numerical.simulations
Mostly simulates ODE models of interest to me as a theoretical biologist and mathematical modeler.
ODEs are as vital to mathematical modeling as oxygen is to (most) life...
Here, you find mathematical models I've toyed with in the past.
Some of these are simulations of the work of others, some are entirely my models.
Do whatever you like, but if it's my model please hit me up and we can collaborate.
Math exists to make us free by giving us new and deeper insights into the world around us.
Thus, my Github exists to make us all free(er).
In particular, cannibal math and my first ODE model of aging would be delighted to have new life breathed into them.
Ratio-dependent predation would also be interesting to add some things onto.
